                        <p>IEEE-HKN, is the latest branch of this esteemed society. It was formed in 2011. 
                            IEEE-HKN stands for IEEE “eta-kappa-nu”. “Lambda Eta” is the chapter that 
                            has been set up in our college. It is the second international chapter of IEEE-
                            HKN and is the first one of its kind to be set up in India. <br/><br/>
                            Our college is truly privileged to be an integral part of such an exciting 
                            international venture. It is an honour and also a due recognition of the efforts of 
                            our staff and students at maintaining a high standard of education. <br/><br/>
                            The chapter attained great heights in its inaugural year itself and to realize its 
                            potential, I was entrusted with the responsibility of being the President for the 
                            academic year 2012-2013. Throughout the year, the team has continued with 
                            the tradition for growth by introducing new events and activities. As the chapter 
                            was still in its nascent stage, there were opportunities to innovate and organize 
                            interactive events to increase exposure to this society.<br/><br/>
                            A range of activities, which encompassed almost all the aspects of students’ life 
                            were organized. The events that were initiated this year included The Student 
                            Recognition Program- acknowledging the academic achievers of every class, 
                            Social Awareness Program- where the chapter was associated with an NGO, 
                            Plants Guardian, and carried out plantation drives across the college, Placement 
                            talks, Student Mentorship Programs and the monthly E-newsletter, Cognizance- 
                            a one of its kind venture, that kept the students updated with the activities 
                            under Lambda Eta and other college events. The aforementioned programs 
                            were appreciated and very well received by students as well as the faculty, and 
                            established a momentum for the future members of the chapter to carry on. <br/><br/>
                            The Lambda Eta Chapter maintained a profit in its financial statement for the 
                            academic year 2012-2013. During this year, the chapter received funds through 
                            fundraising events like- workshops on technical topics, sponsorships from 
                            Public Sector Industries as well as from corporate world. The funds helped the 
                            chapter promote a number of events like –technical paper presentation, student 
                            orientation program, scholar felicitation program etc. to promote the interests of 
                            students in the IEEE-Eta Kappa Nu along with providing some benefits to the 
                            members<br/><br/>
                            A scholastic honor society, Eta Kappa Nu has numerous award programs 
                            designed to promote and encourage educational excellence in electrical and 
                            computer engineering.<br/><br/>
                            These awards recognize outstanding accomplishments by students, professors, 
                            and industry professionals who make significant contributions to society and 
                            who exemplify a balance of scholarship, service, leadership, and character.
                            Each award credits a specific segment of electrical and computer engineering 
                            and is presented at an appropriate venue. HKN encourages chapters and 
                            individuals to nominate all students and colleagues who deserve to be honored.
