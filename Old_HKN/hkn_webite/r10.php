<p>OThe IEEE Region 10 Congress is biennial event, which provides an 

opportunity for students and young professionals from Asia-Pacific to 

network with like-minded volunteers and share ideas.

Recent editions of the Congress have been hosted by IEEE sections of 

Singapore (2009) and Auckland (2011). The Hyderabad Section of India 

hosted the seventh edition of this Congress from 11-14 July 2013 at Taj 

Krishna, with primary objectives being networking, technology outreach 

and community engagement activities. This international platform has 

been remarkably utilized by Lambda-Eta Chapter HKN, to showcase the 

exemplary achievements and awards of our student branch. A team of 

four students from BVCOE was sponsored at this Congress, by IEEE Eta 

Kappa Nu to assist the Educational Activities Board in making the honor 

society a stronger community in Asia-Pacific region. A booth was put up 

for two days in the exhibition area of Congress to brief delegates about 

the benefits of having an IEEE-HKN student chapter and the complete 

procedure to establish it. Since the selected students have managed to 

attract the attention of many people from various sections in Region 

10, it is expected that this combined effort of HKN and Lambda Eta 

Chapter shall help IEEE-HKN grow further, transforming BVPIEEE into a 

distinguished student branch.<br/>
