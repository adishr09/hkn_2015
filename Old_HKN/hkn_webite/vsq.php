                                <p>BVPIEEE, the IEEE student branch of Bharati Vidyapeeth�s College Of Engineering conducted the 7th edition of Vikram Sarabhai Rotating Shield Quiz inter-college quiz competition on 24th January, 2014 in the college auditorium.</p>

<p>The quiz is one of the premier events of our student branch. This year too, the event was a huge success. Statistics bear out the enormous response that was received as more than 150 ardent teams participated � most of them comprising of two members each, barring some lone wolves who battled like a one-man army. Prizes up to Rs. 35,000 were up for grabs.</p>

<p>The event kicked off with an inaugural ceremony initiated by our Honorable Principal, Prof. Dharmender Saini and, Branch counselor, Mr. Rahul Bahl. The quizmasters, Karthikeya Ramesh and Aryaman Nath, hit a home run that day. The quiz had three rounds. The first round, a warm-up quiz, had twenty three questions with short answers.</p>
	                    
                        <p>Each team gave a stiff competition to each other. The top three teams that made it to the podium after dodging the questions were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shubham Prakhar and Sarthak Khuntia from NSIT</li>
<li>Shashank Singh and Shashwat D. Nagar from NSIT</li>

<li> Anurag and Utkarsh Choudhary from SGGSSC</li>
</ol>
<p>
Finally, NSIT College gathered two accolades in its hat. In addition to the cash prize, the top three teams were also awarded kits from the Kyrion Digital Securities, and scholarships in programs offered by Mahavir Jain Academy. Finally, the event was brought to conclusion by Mr. Rahul Bahl�s golden words.
</p>
<p>
Sagacious and astute answers kept the spirit of competition alive. All in all, it was an engrossing and stimulating event that lived up to its billing as one of Delhi's top inter-college quizzes. The success of the event left the avid quizzers to earnestly wait for the next edition.
